				<h2>The new M3</h2>
				<img src="m3.jpg" alt="m3">
				<p>
					As this iconic sports car enters its sixth generation the BMW M3 Sedan
					and M3 Competition Sedan show just how much racing performance is
					possible with a BMW 3 Series. This comes courtesy of a 480 hp BMW M
					TwinPower Turbo engine, rear-wheel drive and highly developed
					technologies derived from motorsport, such as the M specific suspension
					with Active M Differential. A perfectly graduated manual 6-speed M
					transmission with short, precise shifting enables particularly intensive
					interaction between driver and vehicle - in everyday driving as well as on the racetrack.

				<p>
					The rebel among high-performance sports coupés: BMW M4 Coupé and M4 Competition Coupé offer M
					typical driving dynamics
					at the very highest level. Equipped with the 510 hp BMW M TwinPower Turbo inline 6-cylinder petrol
					engine and numerous
					drivetrain and suspension technologies adapted from motorsport, it lets nothing stand in the way of
					the ultimate driving
					experience. The optional M xDrive* all-wheel drive system with Active M Differential guarantees
					maximum traction in
					everyday driving as well as on the racetrack. The vehicle's athletic character is underlined by the
					powerful new design
					language of BMW M.
